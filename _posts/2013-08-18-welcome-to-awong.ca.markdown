So I've finally gotten around to finishing this iteration of my page. Welcome to
 version 3 of awong.ca! Now with actual content and text!

I've been through quite a few redesigns before I finally settled onto this one,
but I was able to keep some of the look and feel as the previous iteration.

Powering the site now is [Jekyll][jekyll], which I found really easy to get setup and running quickly. I've yet to really dive deep into what Jekyll can do but first impressions of it are quite good. 

I hopefully plan to begin my (late) foray into blogging now that I have a
medium to do so. I will be blogging about almost anything and everything, and
won't be restricting this blog to only be about code.

Thanks for stopping by and making it all the way the bottom here. If you find
anything broken or have some suggestions for me. Please feel free to file
a GitHub issue against the [repository][awmwong-gh] or leave a comment below!
