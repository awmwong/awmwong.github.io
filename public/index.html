          <h1>Hi there!</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Anthony Wong and this is my personal website. I'm a
            Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started programming in junior
            high and have not stopped ever since. I currently identify as an
            iOS developer and enjoy an agile development environment
            for mobile applications. I also enjoy the process of solving hard
            problems companies face, using solutions that are well designed,
            and implemented with clean and efficient code. When I'm not busy with
            an internship or occupied with school work, I spend my free 
            time tinkering with my car, playing the hottest new games,
            or enjoying food with friends.

          <p>
            I attend the University of Waterloo, located in Waterloo, Ontario,
            Canada; one of Canada's most widely-known and recongized 
            engineering schools. Waterloo is famous for its internship system
            called co-op - a series of 4-8 month paid internships in a real work
            environment interlaced with alternating school semesters - that is
            mandatory for many programs at the University. I'm a 4th year
            in the Software Engineering program, which is a co-op exclusive
            program. As a result, I already have 20 months of industry
            experience as a software developer.

              Twitter and Facebook are my primary social networks, but
              I also maintain a professional network through LinkedIn.
              I write and store most of my code on GitHub, and I'm a long time lurker of StackOverflow. Content of this site inspired by
