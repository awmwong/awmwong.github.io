    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Anthony Wong and this is my personal website. Here you'll find
      some information about myself, and my blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started programming in junior high and pretty much haven't stopped
      since. I currently identify as an iOS developer and enjoy an agile
      development environment for mobile applications. I also enjoy the process
      of solving hard problems that companies face, using solutions that are
      well designed, and implemented with clean and efficient code.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not busy with an internship or occupied with school work, I spend
      my free time tinkering with my car, playing the hottest new games, or
      enjoying food with friends.

    <h1>University of Waterloo</h1>
    <h2>Software Engineering - Class of 2014</h2>
    <p>
      I attend the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>,
      located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada; one of Canada's most widely-known
      and recongized engineering schools. Waterloo is famous for its internship
      system called co-op - a series of 4-8 month paid internships in a real
      work environment interlaced with alternating school semesters - that is
      mandatory for many programs at the University. I'm a 4th year in the
      Software Engineering program, which is a co-op exclusive program. As a
      result, I already have 20 months of industry experience as a software
      developer.
