    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Anthony Wong and this is my personal website. Here you'll find
      some information about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started programming in junior high and pretty much haven't stopped
      since. My primary expertise is currently in iOS development, using an agile
      development environment for mobile applications. I enjoy the process
      of solving hard problems that companies face, using solutions that are
      well designed, and implemented with clean and efficient code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend my free time tinkering with my car, playing the hottest new games, or
      enjoying food with friends.

    <h2>Software Engineering - Class of 2014</h2>
    <p>
      I attended the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>,
      located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada; one of Canada's most widely-known
      and recognized engineering schools. I graduated in April of 2014 from the 
      <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/">Honours Software Engineering</a> program,
      receiving my 'Bachelors of Software Engineering, with Distinction'. Waterloo is famous for its internship
      system called co-op - a series of 4-8 month paid internships in a real
      work environment interlaced with alternating school semesters. A list of companies I interned at as a student is listed below.
